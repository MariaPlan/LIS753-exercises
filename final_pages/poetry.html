  <h2>Because I could not stop for Death –</h2>
  <h3>By Emily Dickinson</h3>

  <p>Because I could not stop for Death –
  <br>He kindly stopped for me –
  <br>The Carriage held but just Ourselves –
  <br>And Immortality.</p>

  <p>We slowly drove – He knew no haste
  <br>And I had put away
  <br>My labor and my leisure too,
  <br>For His Civility –</p>

  <p>We passed the School, where Children strove
  <br>At Recess – in the Ring –
  <br>We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –
  <br>We passed the Setting Sun –</p>

  <p>Or rather – He passed Us –
  <br>The Dews drew quivering and Chill –
  <br>For only Gossamer, my Gown –
  <br>My Tippet – only Tulle –</p>

  <p>We paused before a House that seemed
  <br>A Swelling of the Ground –
  <br>The Roof was scarcely visible –
  <br>The Cornice – in the Ground –</p>

  <p>Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet
  <br>Feels shorter than the Day
  <br>I first surmised the Horses' Heads
  <br>Were toward Eternity –</p>

<h2>I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,</h1>
<h3>By Emily Dickinson</h3>
<p>I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
<br>And Mourners to and fro
<br>Kept treading - treading - till it seemed
<br>That Sense was breaking through -</p>

<p>And when they all were seated,
<br>A Service, like a Drum -
<br>Kept beating - beating - till I thought
<br>My mind was going numb -</p>

<p>And then I heard them lift a Box
<br>And creak across my Soul
<br>With those same Boots of Lead, again,
<br>Then Space - began to toll,</p>

<p>As all the Heavens were a Bell,
<br>And Being, but an Ear,
<br>And I, and Silence, some strange Race,
<br>Wrecked, solitary, here -</p>

<p>And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
<br>And I dropped down, and down -
<br>And hit a World, at every plunge,
<br>And Finished knowing - then -</p></div>

<h2>My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun -</h1>
<h3>By Emily Dickinson</h3>

  <p>My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun -
  <br>In Corners - till a Day
  <br>The Owner passed - identified -
  <br>And carried Me away -</p>

  <p>And now We roam in Sovreign Woods -
  <br>And now We hunt the Doe -
  <br>And every time I speak for Him
  <br>The Mountains straight reply -</p>

  <p>And do I smile, such cordial light
  <br>Opon the Valley glow -
  <br>It is as a Vesuvian face
  <br>Had let it’s pleasure through -</p>

  <p>And when at Night - Our good Day done -
  <br>I guard My Master’s Head -
  <br>’Tis better than the Eider Duck’s
  <br>Deep Pillow - to have shared -</p>

  <p>To foe of His - I’m deadly foe -
  <br>None stir the second time -
  <br>On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -
  <br>Or an emphatic Thumb -</p>

  <p>Though I than He - may longer live
  <br>He longer must - than I -
  <br>For I have but the power to kill,
  <br>Without - the power to die -</p>
