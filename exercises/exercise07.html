              <h2>Biography</h2>

          <h2>Battlefield</h2>

            <p>Back when I used to be Indian
            <br>I am standing outside the
            <br>pool hall with my sister.
            <br>She strawberry blonde. Stale sweat
            <br>and beer through the
            <br>open door. A warrior leans on his stick,
            <br>fingers blue with chalk.
            <br>Another bends to shoot.
            <br>His braids brush the green
            <br>felt, swinging to the beat
            <br>of the jukebox. We move away.
            <br>Hank Williams falls again
            <br>in the backseat of a Cadillac.
            <br>I look back.
            <br>A wind off the distant hills lifts my shirt,
            <br>brings the scent
            <br>of wounded horses.
            </p>
