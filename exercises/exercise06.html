          <h2>Battlefield</h2>
<p>Back when I used to be Indian
<br>I am standing outside the
<br>pool hall with my sister.
<br>She strawberry blonde. Stale sweat
<br>and beer through the
<br>open door. A warrior leans on his stick,
<br>fingers blue with chalk.
<br>Another bends to shoot.
<br>His braids brush the green
<br>felt, swinging to the beat
<br>of the jukebox. We move away.
<br>Hank Williams falls again
<br>in the backseat of a Cadillac.
<br>I look back.
<br>A wind off the distant hills lifts my shirt,
<br>brings the scent
<br>of wounded horses.
</p>

<h2>A Blur of Echoes</h2>
<p>Let's forget everything we know to be true about you and me.
<br>Let's just say you were born that day.  We'll say you splashed into
<br>my hands on a salty wave and I licked you clean, sucked the ocean
<br>from your lungs.  Let's say I lifted you, laid you on your mother's
<br>belly, where you squirmed and dreamed like a little idol.  Can we
<br>remember it that way?  Please.  The way her hands looked like
<br>wings as she pulled you to her breast, wept on your face.  You
<br>woke up and stretched your jaw with a yawn that shattered the
<br>window in the room, cracked open the ceiling the roof of our
<br>house and we were covered with snow.  You remember, don't you,
<br>snow falling all day long?  Warm snow, deep snow and the shards
<br>of glass and the glisten of your brand new breath in the air.
<br>
<br>Let's say you crawled you walked you continued to shout at the
<br>sky.  You ate enormous quantities of oatmeal.  Your breath became
<br>brown sugar.  Like your big brother you sang and sometimes
<br>hummed yourself to sleep.  Like your big brother you darkened
<br>under the sun.  You tugged at his flowing yellow hair, you
<br>followed him everywhere.  He was glad you were there most of
<br>the time.  Like your mother you shaped the earth with your
<br>hands.  You drew pictures.  You remember, don't you?  We
<br>covered the walls.  Birds mostly.
<br>
<br>Let's remember it that way.  Let's say my shoulder does not still
<br>wait for you to arrive.  Your face and closed eyes do not look in at
<br>me through every window.  For me, each fall of snow is not
<br>beautiful and somehow dead.  I do not gasp awake and shake in
<br>my bed certain that I hear you humming.  My night is not filled
<br>with sounds.  My night is not a blur of echoes.  I do not separate
<br>them out one by one, try to narrow them down to something I can
<br>name.  Birds mostly.</p>

<h2>Visitation</h2>
<p>Back when I used to be Indian
<br>I am six maybe seven
<br>years old, restless, pretending to sleep
<br>stove. My sister's back is warm
<br>and still against my own.
<br>A straw in the blanket scratches my ankle.
<br>Somewhere in the darkness
<br>my mother and her husband grunt
<br>and hiss, hands over mouths.
<br>I blink.
<br>Across the room a buffalo snorts,
<br>nudges the yellow Tonka truck
<br>with its nose.</p>
